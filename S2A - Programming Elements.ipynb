    "*   Well-structured\n",
    "*   Maintainable\n",
    "*   Readable\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Principles of Good Programming Style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Use Comments Effectively:**\n",
    "    *   Include header comments (programmer name, date, description, version).\n",
    "    *   Explain the purpose of functions/algorithms (objectives, inputs, outputs).\n",
    "    *   Clarify complex logic, but avoid explaining basic syntax.\n",
    "2.  **Use Meaningful Identifiers:**\n",
    "    *   Variable/function names should be descriptive (e.g., `total_score` instead of `ts`).\n",
    "    *   Avoid single letters unless conventional (like `i`, `j`, `k` for loop counters).\n",
    "3.  **Apply Proper Indentation and White Space:**\n",
    "    *   Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces) to show code structure (loops, conditionals).\n",
    "    *   Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code.\n",
    "4.  **Adhere to Specifications:**\n",
    "    *   Ensure the program meets all requirements defined in the problem statement.\n",
    "5.  **Avoid Deep Nesting:**\n",
    "    *   Limit nesting levels of loops and `IF` statements, as excessive nesting reduces readability and can increase execution time. Consider refactoring into functions if nesting becomes too deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Coding Standards in A-Level Practical Exams\n",
    "\n",
    "Marks are awarded for:\n",
    "*   **Indentation and White Space:** Proper and consistent use.\n",
    "*   **Meaningful Identifiers:** Clear, descriptive names for variables, constants, functions, etc.\n",
    "*   **Comments:** Inclusion of comments to clarify code logic or purpose."

    "\n",
    "*   **Finite:** Fixed number of elements, determined at declaration.\n",
    "*   **Ordered:** Each element has a specific position (index).\n",
    "*   **Same Data Type:** All elements must be integers, reals, characters, etc.\n",
    "*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements are typically stored next to each other in memory.\n",
    "*   **Access:** Elements are accessed using the array name and an index (e.g., `myArray[3]`).\n",
    "*   **Indexing:**\n",
    "    *   **Pseudo-code:** Often uses 1-based indexing (e.g., `ARRAY[1:10]`). Bounds (`L:U`) are inclusive. Can also use `ARRAY[<size>]`.\n",

    "*   **Popping:** When a function returns, its stack frame is popped off the stack, and control returns to the return address stored in the frame below it.\n",
    "*   **Recursion & Stack:** Each recursive call pushes a new stack frame. Deep recursion can lead to many frames.\n",
    "*   **Stack Overflow:** If the call stack runs out of memory (exceeds its maximum size) due to too many nested or recursive calls without returning (e.g., infinite recursion), a **stack overflow error** occurs, crashing the program.\n",
